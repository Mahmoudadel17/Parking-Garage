# Parking-Garage-Application

# i) Note 
You will find the project details in "C251-Project Description-ParkingGarage-v2.1.pdf"

# ii) INTRODUCTION
• In this project you will collect the requirements, design, and implement a non-trivial software system. You will practice the concepts you learned during the course.

# iii) PROJECT DETAILS

Apply the Object-Oriented concepts that you’ve learned (Abstraction, polymorphism, interfaces, packaging, …) utilizing Boundary, control and entity concepts as well as SOLID Principles to design a Parking Garage application and implement it using an object-oriented programming language. This application manages a parking space for a configurable maximum number of vehicles. Each parking space (slot) defined with a dimension (width and depth) The designed application must handle the following functions:
• Each vehicle shall be identified by a model name, unique identification number, Model year and vehicle dimensions (vehicle width and depth).
• Park-in function that marks the arrival time of a vehicle if there is an available slot. The application shall capture such time automatically from the system.
• During the park-in function the application shall pick a free slot based on the active slot configuration. There are two configurations (i) first come first served slots i.e., the park-in function will use the first free slot available from the parking garage slots. (ii) best-fit approach where you need to find the slot with the minimum dimension to hold the vehicle.
• Park-out function that marks the departure time of a vehicle from the garage. The application shall capture such time automatically from the system.
• Calculate the parking fees during the park-out based on the time-of-stay with an hourly rate of 5 EGP.
• Calculate the total income as well as the total number of vehicles that used the parking garage at any given point in time.
• Display the available parking slots
• Enrich your application with the capability to handle a set of exceptions that can happen during user interaction and through any other calculations. The displayed error message for exceptional behavior should be descriptive.
